        <description>

        <description>
            <p>At level 1 you have your own self-built mech suit and you are proficient with it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mech suit is treated as a piece of heavy armor, granting you <i>14 AC</i> while piloting it. Its AC cannot be raised by the armor you are wearing. To get into your mech, you may spend your movement to get to and into it and your action to get set up and ready.</p>
            <p class="indent">Completely erected, your mech is 3 feet taller and up to 2 feet wider than you. Its weight is three times as much as yours. Since it's powered, your mech's weight does not count towards your encumbrance.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mech has a base movement of 30. While piloting it, you may add your Intelligence modifier to Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mech has separate hit points. While piloting it, it takes damage instead of you (except cold, necrotic, poison and psychic. This damage is dealt to you directly).</p>
            <p class="indent">When its hit points reach 0, it can no longer be used until it is repaired. If damage exceeds the mech's current hit points, you take the remaining damage. Should your mech be destroyed completely (fallen down a cliff or similar), you can build a new mech within two days. The iron needed for this is equal to your Mech Pilot level times ten. The time needed to build a new mech can be reduced by half for every creature helping you. All mechs have the same modules and properties.</p>
            <h4 class="caption">Mech Hit Points</h4>
            <p><strong>Mech's Hit Points at first level:</strong> 6 + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Mech's Hit Points per level:</strong> 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            <p class="indent">While resting, you may use one of your hit dice to repair your mech regaining it <i>1d6 + your Intelligence modifier</i> hit points, resulting in you not healing because of the exhaustion. Repairing your mech counts as light activity for you, allowing you to keep an eye out for others. When your mech is repaired by magical means (such as mending), consume one hit dice to have it gain that many hit points.</p>
            <h4 class="caption">Mech Attacks</h4>
            <p>The mech is equipped with ranged and melee primary weapons. These can be exchanged as any other weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent">The mech has two arms, each mounted with on-board primary weapons, so Two-Weapon-Fighting is possible beginning at level 1.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mech's melee attacks deal bludgeoning damage and its ranged attacks deal piercing damage. Its damage is equal to <i>1d6 + your Dexterity modifier</i></p>
            <p class="indent">To perform a ranged attack however, you have to be anchored to the ground, allowing you to withstand the immense knockback but also renders you immobile. You can engage or disengage these anchors as a bonus action each turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">While anchored, your mech has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and it is resistant to abilities that cause it to move.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>(Range: 80/320)</i></p>
            <h4 class="caption">Ability Modifiers</h4>
            <p>Instead of spells, you gain access to abilities that can be treated as spells. Your Spellcasting Modifier is Intelligence.</p>
            <p class="indent">Some of your features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature's effects.</p>
            <p class="indent">If not stated otherwise, the saving throw DC for your abilities is calculated as follows: <i>8 + your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency modifier.</i></p>
            <p class="indent">Other abilities require you to make a spell attack. Your spell attack's roll is a <i>d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your Proficiency modifier.</i></p>
            <center>
				<p><strong>Mech Pilot save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Mech Pilot spell attack modifier</strong> = Your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

            <p class="indent">You may choose to implant modules into your living body or create a carriable, smaller version that can also be grafted to light armor. This process will take four hours and cost materials worth 50 gp. For the module to work, you have to succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check on a DC of 8 + module level prerequisite. If you fail the check, the module will not work and you take necrotic damage equal to the module's level prerequisite. The time needed to construct a module can be halved by getting help.</p>

            <p><em>Prerequisite: 1st level</em></p>
            <p>You are proficient with poisons. Because of your chemical expertise, you were able to assemble a Poisoner's Kit, allowing you to create and replicate potent poisons.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mech may, as an action, expell a cloud of noxious gas in a cone in front of it. This cone's size is equal to twice your Intelligence modifier + 5 ft. The cloud will persist until the end of your next round. This area becomes heavily obscured. Creatures being in or entering that cloud have to make a Constitution saving throw. On a fail, they take 1d12 poison damage and become poisoned for one minute. On a success, they take half that damage and are not poisoned.</p>
            <p class="indent">The poison gas can be used once per long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">The number of uses increases by one at level 5, 11 and 17.</p>
            <p class="indent">This apparatus can expell any substance that can be dispersed through the air. The affected area stays the same.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your poisons ignore resistance to poisons and treat immunity to poisons as resistance.</p>
