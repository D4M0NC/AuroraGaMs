        <description>
            <p>Big, strong, fast and wise, wolfkin are wolf-like humanoids; with wolfen ancestors. Their feet and hands are similar to those of the paws of their wolf ancestors, but their hands have evolved to be able to hold items. They are covered in fur like their lesser kin.</p>
            <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>The wolfkin are a race that swore to defend their pack at all costs. Few can remember how they came about but the pack elders say that it was during a time of great turmoil in the world that their kind were brought about. The elders tell stories of great battles, with both victories and defeats, and to these stories the younglings listen most eagerly. The more popular of these stories is that the wolfkin descended from the first of wolf-like therianthropes, though not necessarily lycanthropes. It is a bit murky, as they are not related to the true lycans that are associated with the goddess Selune, but likely perhaps a terrestrial spirit or deity.</p>
            <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>Despite their brutal appearances; they are a people who cherish, and defend the lives of all good creatures as if they were their own. Their society functions similar to a typical society built by humans, however, they only kill another of their kind in ritualistic situations or in self-defense, if their fellow wolfkin has succumbed to evil, or disease.</p>
            <h4>NAMES</h4>
            <p>A wolfkin's name is a rite of passage. A special ceremony is held to give a young wolf their name when they are old enough to finally help provide food and protection for the clan. As such, their names are typically unisex.</p>
            <p><b>Names:</b> Leslas, Ukrim, Ildrun, Daomri, Tusbo, Irvas, Naumdrik, Helgros, Urvas, Nagram</p>
